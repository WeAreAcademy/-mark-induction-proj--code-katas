You're now going to reinforce the TDD process and your Python skills by completing a series of Exercism katas.

## Learning Outcomes

- Read tests written with `unittest`
- Use a test-driven development process

## Exercise 1: Exercism Hello World

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** A completed and submitted version of the Exercism _Hello World_ problem

[Exercism](https://exercism.io/) has lots of exercises for a variety of challenges.

In this exercise, you'll complete the basic [Python Hello World](https://exercism.io/my/solutions/6f11fab2612a4b46986e00b1157b7ada) challenge.

Exercism has a pretty good [Getting Started](https://exercism.io/getting-started) guide and documentation - see what you can do by following their guides!

Note that Exercism's Python tests are written using `unittest`, so it is worth checking [the relevant documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) if you need help understanding it.

### Submitting your solutions to Exercism
When you are ready to submit, navigate to the folder which your solution is in. For example, `cd ~/Exercism/python/hello-world`. Then run the command `exercism submit <filename.fileextension>`, so for hello world in python this would be `exercism submit hellow-world.py`.

## Exercise 2: Further Exercism challenges

At this point in time - one week into your full-time training! - we recommend working through the challenges labelled as 'Easy'.

We also recommend adding in your own custom tests for smaller helper functions that you write as part of your solution, as with in [FizzBuzz](https://github.com/WeAreAcademy/mark-induction-proj--fizzbuzz), so that you are practising test-driven development.
