FizzBuzz is a coding interview classic. In this project, you're going to write a solution for it and begin using TDD in the process.

## Learning Outcomes

- Read tests written with `unittest`
- Use a test-driven development process

## Exercise 1: Exercism Hello World

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** A completed and submitted version of the Exercism _Hello World_ problem

[Exercism](https://exercism.io/) has lots of exercises for a variety of challenges.

In this exercise, you'll complete the basic [Python Hello World](https://exercism.io/my/solutions/6f11fab2612a4b46986e00b1157b7ada) challenge.

Exercism has a pretty good [Getting Started](https://exercism.io/getting-started) guide and documentation - see what you can do by following their guides!

Note that Exercism's Python tests are written using `unittest`, so it is worth checking [the relevant documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) if you need help understanding it.

## Exercise 2: Further Exercism challenges

At this point in time - one week into your full-time training! - we recommend working through the challenges labelled as 'Easy'.

We also recommend adding in your own custom tests for smaller helper functions that you write as part of your solution, as with in [FizzBuzz](https://github.com/WeAreAcademy/mark-induction-proj--fizzbuzz), so that you are practising test-driven development.
